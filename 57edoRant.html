        <main>
            <section>
                <p>Today I spent pretty much all day studying microtonality, keyboard isomorphism, and MOS (moment of symmetry) scales. I don't really know why they are called Moment Of Symmetry scales, but maybe I'll explain my understanding of MOSses later.</p>
                <p>I am probably going to buy a Lumatone in the next couple of months, which is exciting! Something interesting that I noticed was that I have been kind of limiting myself mentally as to what I can do musically until I get the Lumatone. Those limitations are not very real though; I have Ableton, which is capable of rendering arbitrary microtonal music, and the Virtual TERP Strike keyboard is available online to try out, which is visually extremely similar to the Lumatone. There were also plenty of investigations that I wanted to do before really diving into the Lumatone to ensure that I was getting as much out of it as I hoped to. I made a video (linked below, but maybe you came from that video in the first place!) that is somewhat of a product of the beginning of my investigations.</p>
                <p>What I hoped to do at the beginning of these investigations was to discover a well-defined way to create a keyboard mapping for the Lumatone for any EDO in such a way that each EDO would place intervals in similar places on the keyboard; octaves would stay in the same place; whole tones and half tones would stay as close to 12-edo as possible; all notes of the EDO would be easily and intuitively accessible; and the mapping would form a repeating vertical pattern such that there would be duplicates of all the notes available in higher or lower rows to facilitate more options for fingerings. However, I discovered that many of these goals are in direct mathematical and geometric conflict with each other.</p>
                <p>My findings make the most sense when we consider starting the investigations from the point of trying to replicate the Bosanquet-Wilson layout. That keyboard layout has always been my favorite. I loved its vertical repeating patterns, the familiarity with a normal piano, and the intuitive and flexible nature of its structure: Move to the right to go up a whole tone, move up-right or down-right to go up a semitone. Can we make such a layout for any EDO? Turns out the answer is no!</p>
                <p>One key point I discovered was that what I was looking for was a keyboard mapping that supported a 5L+2S MOS scale. Of course, as long as all the notes of an EDO are available on the keyboard, you can play any scale made of those notes (and the way to do this is to ensure the value of L and S are coprime!). But the question is: where do you want the octave to end up? I like the 12edo Bosanquet-Wilson layout because the octave occurs both at the end of playing a diatonic scale, and at the end of playing a whole-tone scale. So, what if we wanted to try to replicate those properties? Let's start with creating the diatonic scale structure.</p>
                <p>So, what does MOS mean to me? It simply is a description of a scale defined by only two sizes of intervals (Large, and Small, or L and S). The numbers correspond to how many large and small steps make up the scale. For example, 2L+3S could be a pentatonic scale, and 5L+2S can describe the diatonic scale, including the ionian (major) scale like this: LLSLLLS. I'm not sure if my understanding is totally correct, and it is probably the case that we don't need the entirety of the concept of MOSses to complete the present investigations, but that's how I started thinking about it and it's how I still think about it.</p>
                <p>Then I started wondering: why does everyone seem to be talking about MOSses like we can only have 2 intervals to choose from (Large and Small)? Well, there seem to be some sound mathematical reasons that I don't understand, but then I realized: in the case of creating keyboard mappings for the Lumatone, <strong><u>only MOSses that are made of 2 component intervals</u></strong> (which might be a redundant phrase) <strong><u>make sense</u></strong>. This is because the entirety of a keyboard mapping on a plane tiled with hexagons is defined by just 2 component intervals, each running along a certain axis. In the case of the Lumatone, it is useful to think about these intervals as running along the "rightwards" (or R) axis, and the "down-and-to-the-right" (or DR) axis. For example, just like we said earlier, the 12edo Bosanquet-Wilson layout can be created by setting R=2, and DR=1, where those numbers represent the number of edo-steps that we increase by as we step in that direction (edo-steps will come up more later).</p>
                <p>So now we understand that the specification of the MOS scale we are creating our keyboard mapping for defines where the octave will end up. If we create a mapping for 5L+2S, that means if we travel 5 steps to the right, and 2 steps to the down-right, then we will end up an octave up from where we started. And as it turns out, the ionian (major) scale and all of its modes are all 5L+2S. Of course, many more possible MOSses exist to create isomorphic mappings for, but 5L+2S seems like a great option because of its versatility and familiarity. And remember, it's not like we're going to be unable to play other scales using this mapping. The choice of a MOS to create the mapping for simply defines the size and shape of the octaves on the mapping. </p>
                <p>As it turns out, the Lumatone is not an axis-aligned hexagonal plane. It has been rotated slightly counterclockwise, such that if you keep moving along the R axis, you will fall off the top edge of the keyboard before reaching its far-right side. And as it turns out, the angle at which is tilted was very likely tailor-made for 5L+2S mappings, because if you move 5 steps to the right, and 2 steps to the down-right, you will end up at the exact same vertical position as you started at. Coincidence? I think not! The designers of the lumatone<strong><em>want</em></strong> us to use 5L+2S mappings so that octaves end up perfectly parallel to the length of the instrument itself. Of course, we still can create and user other mappings, it's just that their octaves-axes will be tilted off of the horizontal.</p>
                <p>But let's stick with 5L+2S for now. Can we create a 5L+2S mapping for any EDO? Well I already said the answer is no, but why is that? It's certainly desirable; it would be nice to have something that resembles a typical major scale in any EDO, and the Lumatone designers seem to agree. The reason it doesn't work for all EDOs is a simple consequence of the numbers involved. If we want to end up at an octave after taking 5 Large steps and 2 Small steps, then the total number of edo-steps we take in those 7 steps must equal the edo-number itself. So we get this equation:</p>
                <div style="font-family: 'Fira Mono', 'Consolas', monospace; background: #f3f3f3; padding: 0.5em 1em; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block; margin: 0.5em 0;">
                    <strong>EDO = 5L + 2S</strong>
                </div>
                <p>Of course, this works for 12edo, just substitute in 2 (2 semitones/edo-steps) for Large, and 1 (1 semitone/edo-step) for Small:</p>
                <div style="font-family: 'Fira Mono', 'Consolas', monospace; background: #f3f3f3; padding: 0.5em 1em; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block; margin: 0.5em 0;">
                    <strong>12 = 5 × 2 + 2 × 1</strong>
                </div>
                <p>But I bet you can already guess there are some numbers for which this equation has no integer solutions. For example, there is no way to create the number 13 from a combination of 5s and 2s. So numbers can we create? We can simply enumerate over all possible solutions by plugging in values for L and S. We use the constraints that L>S, and L and S are both positive integers. Some possible combinations include (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), etc. However, remember that I mentioned earlier that L and S must be coprime in order for the mapping to generate all possible notes in the EDO, so we shouldn't use (4, 2) and other combinations in which L and S have a common factor other than 1.</p>
                <p>So I used Google Sheets to enumerate over 5L+2S-compatible EDOs. This could be taken out to infinity, but I stopped my investigation when it got to the point where all the individual notes would no longer fit on the Lumatone when using this 5L+2S Bosanquet-Wilson layout (the maximum EDO that still works with this format is 56-edo). Here are all the EDOs that are compatible with a 5L+2S mapping on the Lumatone!:</p>
                <div style="font-family: 'Fira Mono', 'Consolas', monospace; background: #f3f3f3; padding: 0.5em 1em; border-radius: 5px; margin: 0.5em 0;">
                    7, 12, 17, 19, 22, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56
                </div>
                <p>(47 actually has 2 ways of being arranged that satisfies 5L+2S!) </p>
                <p>Note: all such Bosanquet-Wilson layouts generated using the method described here have a total range of almost 5 octaves on the Lumatone. Again, that's a cool inherent property of this method; the size of the octave will be the same for all possible EDOs used.</p>
                <p>This is a great list, and if you've been researching microtonality for even a little bit of time, you probably recognize a lot of those numbers. Of course, there's 12, but 19, 22, 31, and 53 are exceptionally common in published microtonal music, and they're all compatible with the 5L+2S Bosanquet-Wilson layout… coincidence? I think not! However, I'm not sure if that's due to a property of the layout itself, or if the layout just happens to coincide with auditorily pleasing EDOs (perhaps those two things are mathematically intertwined, or even equivalent in some sense! Maybe I'll investigate that question someday). </p>
                <p>However, there are many EDOs that are unfortunately not present. No multiples of 12 other than 12 itself are present. There is just no way to make them work without using values that aren't coprime for L and S. I would have also liked to have seen 16edo, and maybe 10edo and 9edo as well, but again, they just don't work for this kind of layout. The octave cannot be placed at the 5L+2S location for them. So I'll have to find another way to make those layouts work.</p>
                <p>That's kind of a sobering fact - for a given desired octave shape, and a given EDO, there may be no possible way to isomorphically map that EDO such that its octave takes on that shape. That limits our options and I don't think there's anything we can do about that. However, I am quite happy to start with the 5L+2S layout, and prior to these investigations, I had already been really excited about working with 12, 17, 19, 22, 31, 41, and 53, so I'm confident that the 5L+2S layout will provide me a lot of satisfaction for a long time. Still, that won't stop me from trying to make other layout schemes that are compatible with other EDOs. I could try learning another MOS structure - learn another set of fingerings and intuition about where pitches and intervals are placed. I could pick a MOS that catches a lot of the EDOs that 5L+2S missed. That's one idea, but I have 2 more ideas. One is to try to create a scheme for creating a mapping for any EDO such that the associated mapping for each EDO always approximates certain intervals for L and S as close as possible, or places the octave as close to the 5L+2S position as possible. The other idea is to look for a scheme that creates mappings that all have the same fine-tuning direction. I haven't talked about the fine-tuning direction yet; let's build up to that now!</p>
                <p>The whole point of trying to come up with a mapping scheme for any EDO is so that I can develop a solid intuition and muscle memory for pitch relationships on the Lumatone no matter what EDO I'm playing with. That way, I can easily switch EDOs without having to start learning again from scratch. I'll know at least that if I play LLSLLLS, it will sound at least somewhat like a major scale, and I'll know where octaves are.</p>
                <p>My next hope was that all of the EDOs in this layout scheme would have the same fine-tuning direction. What I mean by that is that if I'm playing, and I find a note to be slightly too sharp for my liking, I'd like to be able to move a certain direction (say, up-left) to flatten it by a single edo-step. Unfortunately, this layout scheme does not make any robust guarantees in that regard (at least, I haven't found any). By requiring a certain direction to be the fine-tuning direction (meaning, the interval in that direction is 1 edo-step), we limit the possible EDOs that will fit into 5L+2S, and we limit what their major scale in 5L+2S can sound like. The goals of a consistent octave shape and a consistent fine-tuning direction are not necessarily in conflict with each other, but they also seem to not really make any guarantees about each other.</p>
                <p>So, will it be a big problem to have to learn and remember different fine-tuning directions for each EDO? It certainly doesn't seem ideal, but I'll have to do some more investigations or wait to actually try it on the Lumatone to say for sure. Luckily though, for most of the aforementioned 5L+2S-compatible EDOs, the fine-tuning direction is not that bad. For many of them, it is simply in the DR direction (down and to the right), which is my personal favorite fine-tuning direction in concept (good for glissandos, easily accessible). 12, 17, and 22 (and more) use DR as their fine-tuning direction in 5L+2S. Many others can be fine-tuned in the UR direction (up and to the right), which seems to me to be the 2nd best fine-tuning direction. It's not as long on the Lumatone as the DR direction, but it's still contiguous and easily accessible. 12, and 19 (and more) use UR as their fine-tuning direction in 5L+2S. (You may have noticed that 12edo has both UR and DR as a fine-tuning direction; that is a special property of the 2nd EDO in the list of EDOs produced using this method. Because L=2 and S=1, the interval produced by a DR jump is the same as the one produced by a UR jump. L=2 and S=1 is the only pair that has this property! This is what causes that perfectly vertical repeating pattern that I described at the beginning! Unfortunately, this means that for 5L+2S, only 12edo will have this property.)</p>
                <p>Other EDOs start to get a little more complicated. For some, you simply have to travel up or down vertically (1L-2S or 2S-1L), which is not that bad, but it's unfortunate that for some, traveling upwards means increasing by 1 edo-step, while for others, it means decreasing by 1 edo-step. That might be a little annoying to try to remember. It might hinder muscle memory. 17, 41, and 53 (and more) all increase by 1 edo-step as you move up vertically, but 19 and 31 (and more) decrease by 1 edo-step as you move up vertically.</p>
                <p>Then, there are other EDOs whose fine-tuning direction is not UR, DR, or vertical. It's a more complicated sequence of jumps. To name a few, this includes 39, 46, 56, and more. That is unfortunate, and that's why I want to do another investigation into fine-tuning direction, but that will have to wait until later.</p>
                <p>Despite the limitations of the 5L+2S mapping system, I would still love to try out many of these EDOs using this layout; it could be awesome! I think the muscle memory from 12edo will probably be easily leveraged in other EDOs this way. But who knows! Maybe I'll come up with a better system later. Or maybe I'll have to succumb to the fact that every EDO will require learning new muscle memory.</p>
                <p>Another point in favor of these 5L+2S mappings is that many of them approximate some of my favorite intervals well (such as 5/4, 7/4, and 3/2). From the above list, the <strong>Highly-Good-for-Just-Intonation EDOs</strong> are: 7, 12, 19, 22, 31, 46, and 53 <em>(that is a term I made up based on the concept behind highly-composite numbers. I bet if you look that up you can figure out what I mean here, basically each EDO in that list approximates none of those 3 intervals I mentioned any worse than all previous EDOs)</em>.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Anyways, what was the point of this rant? Oh yeah! Explaining that YouTube video I made. 37edo doesn't approximate JI particularly well, but it has a very large ratio of L:S, meaning its small step in the major scale is indeed really small, and the large steps are quite large. This leads to a really interesting sound that I liked. I also really enjoyed how its fine-tuning direction was in the DR direction. So, I ended up having some fun playing around with it on the virtual terpstra website, and recorded a little demo of some of the cool chords it can make.</p>
