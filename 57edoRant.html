Today I spent prety much all day studying microtonality, keyboard isomorphism, and MOS (moment of symmetry) scales. I don't really know why they are called Moment Of Symmetry scales, but maybe I'll explain my understanding of MOSses later.

I am probably going to buy a Lumatone in the next couple of months, which is exciting! Something interesting that I noticed was that I have been kind of limiting myself mentally as to what I can do musically until I get the Lumatone. Those limitations are not very real though; I have Ableton, which is capable of rendering arbitrary microtonal music, And the Virtual TERP Strike keyboard is available online to try out, which is visually extremely similar to the Lumatone. There were also plenty of investigations that I wanted to do before really diving into the Lumatone to ensure that I was getting as much out of it as I hoped to. This video is somewhat of a product of the beginning of my investigations.

What I hoped to do at the beginning of these investigations was to discover a well-defined way To create a keyword mapping for the lumatone for any EDO in such a way that each EDO would place intervals in similar places on the keyboard; octaves would stay in the same place; whole tones and half tones would stay as close to 12-edo as possible; all notes of the EDO would be easily and intuitively accessible; and the mapping would form a repeating vertical pattern such that there would be duplicates of all the notes available in higher or lower rows to facilitate more options for fingerings. However, I discovered that many of these goals are in direct mathematical and geometric conflict with each other.

My findings make the most sense when we consider starting the investigations from the point of trying to replicate the Bosanquet-Wilson layout. That keyboard layout has always been my favorite. I loved its vertical repeating patterns, the familiarity with a normal piano, and the intuitive and flexible nature of its structure: Move to the right to go up a whole tone, move up-right or down-right to go up a semitone. Can we make such a layout for any EDO? Turns out the answer is no!

One key point I discovered was that what I was looking for was a keyboard mapping that supported a 5L+2S MOS scale. Of course, as long as all the notes of an EDO are available on the keyboard, you can play any scale made of those notes (and the way to do this is to ensure the value of L and S are coprime!). But the question is: where do you want the octave to end up? I like the 12edo Bosanquet-Wilson layout because the octave occurs both at the end of playing a diatonic scale, and at the end of playing a whole-tone scale. So, what if we wanted to try to replicate those properties? Let's start with creating the diatonic scale structure.

So, what does MOS mean to me? It simply is a description of a scale defined by only two sizes of intervals (Large, and Small, or L and S). The numbers correspond to how many large and small steps make up the scale. For example, 2L+3S could be a pentatonic scale, and 5L+2S can describe the diatonic scale, including the ionian (major) scale like this: LLSLLLS. I'm not sure if my understanding is totally correct, and it is probably the case that we don't need the entirety of the concept of MOSses to complete the present investigations, but that's how I started thinking about it and it's how I still think about it.

Then I started wondering: 

The bottom line is: if we want a keyboard layout
